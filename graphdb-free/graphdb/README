Prerequisites
-------------
GraphDB is a Java application and requires Java 8. Make sure you have an up-to-date Java 8 installation.
You can download Java from https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml.

Starting GraphDB
----------------
Run the graphdb script in the bin directory. To access the Workbench, open http://localhost:7200 in a browser.

To run GraphDB on a different port, add the parameter "-Dgraphdb.connector.port=<your-port>".
This option can also be set in the config file graphdb.properties in the conf directory.

To run GraphDB in server-only mode without the embedded Workbench, add the parameter "-s".

Creating Repositories
---------------------
By default, the GraphDB will initialise a location but not create any repositories.
You can create a new repository or connect to an existing one from the menu Setup -> Repositories page
in the GraphDB Workbench:

    - To create a new repository in the location, click on "Create new repository"" and fill in the form.
    - To connect to a repository, use the dropdown in the menu or the slider next to the repo name on the same page.
