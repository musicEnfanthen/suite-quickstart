2. Unzip the file gremlin-groovy-2.6.0.zip into a convenient location.
3. Go to the newly extracted folder, e.g. my_files/gremlin-groovy-2.6.0.
3. Put the file graphdb-blueprints-rdf.jar into the lib subfolder.
4. Run the Gremlin console by executing bin/gremlin.sh or bin/gremlin.bat.
5. Connect to a GraphDB repository by executing one of the following:
   g = new com.ontotext.blueprints.GraphDBSailGraph("<URL to a GraphDB repository>")
       or
   g = new com.ontotext.blueprints.GraphDBSailGraph("<URL to a GraphDB repository>", "<username>", "<password>")
