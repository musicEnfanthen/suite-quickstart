v1.1.0 Release Notes
====================

See the
[release](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/releases/tag/v1.1.0) on
Github.

Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------

### 1. Project ontologies property changed:

The `knora-base:projectOntologyGraph` needs to be renamed to
`knora-base:projectOntology`. Also before it was a `xsd:string`, where
now it needs to be an IRI. The graph where the ontology is stored will
need to have the same name.

### 2. Project data graph property removed:

The property `knora-base:projectDataGraph` needs to be removed.

### 2. Project shortcode property added:

The `knora-base:projectShortcode` property was added. When adding a
project shortcode, we also need to update:

1.  the IRI of the project to: `http://rdfh.ch/projects/[shortcode]`
2.  the IRIs all project ontologies to:
    `http://www.knora.org/ontology/[shortcode]/[ontoname]`
3.  the IRIs of lists to: `http://rdfh.ch/lists/[shortcode]/[UUID]`
4.  the IRIs of groups to: `http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]`
