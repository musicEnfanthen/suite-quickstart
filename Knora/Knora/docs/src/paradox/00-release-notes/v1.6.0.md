[v1.6.0 milestone](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/milestone/10) on Github.

Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------

- A project is now required to have at least one description, so potentially a description will need
  to be added to those projects that don't have one.

New features:
-------------

General:

- Added a `/health` endpoint
- KnoraService waits on startup for a triplestore before trying to load the ontologies

Gravsearch enhancements:

- Accept queries in POST requests (@github[#650](#650)).
- Allow a Gravsearch query to specify the IRI of the main resource (@github[#871](#871)) (by allowing `BIND`).
- Allow `lang` to be used with `!=`.
- A `UNION` or `OPTIONAL` can now be nested in an `OPTIONAL` (@github[#882](#882)).
- Gravsearch now does type inference (@github[#884](#884)).
- The Knora API v2 complex schema can now be used in Gravsearch, making it possible to search
  for list nodes (@github[#899](#899)).

Admin API:

- Make project description required (@github[#875](#875)).

Conversion to TEI:

- Conversion of standard standoff entities to TEI
- Custom conversion of project specific standoff entities and metadata to TEI

Sipi integration:

- The Knora specific Sipi configuration and scripts can now be found under the `sipi/` directory (@github[#404](#404)).

- Exclude list values from v2 fulltext search (@github[#906](#906)).

Gravsearch fixes:

- Allow the `lang` function to be used in a comparison inside AND/OR (@github[#846](#846)).
- Fix the processing of resources with multiple incoming links that use the same property (@github[#878](#878)).
- Fix the parsing of a FILTER inside an OPTIONAL (@github[#879](#879)).
- Require the `match` function to be the top-level expression in a `FILTER`.
