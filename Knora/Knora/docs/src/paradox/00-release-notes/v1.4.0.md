v1.4.0 Release Notes
====================

See the
[release](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/releases/tag/v1.4.0) and closed tickets on the
[v1.4.0 milestone](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/milestone/8) on Github.

Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------

- Every ontology must now have the property `knora-base:attachedToProject`, which points to the IRI of the project
  that is responsible for the ontology. This must be added to each project-specific ontology in existing repositories.
  All built-in ontologies have been updated to have this property, and must therefore be reloaded into existing
  repositories.  
  The property `knora-base:projectOntology` has been removed, and must be removed from project definitions in
  existing repositories.

- Every project now needs to have the property `knora-base:projectShortcode` set.

New features:
-------------

- Added OpenAPI / Swagger API documentation route
- Knora now checks the validity of ontologies on startup.
- The property ``knora-base:projectShortcode`` is now a required property (was optional).

Bugfixes:
---------

-   API v1 extended search was not properly handling multiple conditions
    on list values (issue \#800)
-   Fix image orientation in SALSAH 1 (issue \#726)
