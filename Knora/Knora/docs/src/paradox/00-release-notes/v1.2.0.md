v1.2.0 Release Notes
====================

See the
[release](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and
closed tickets on the [v1.2.0
milestone](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/milestone/6) on Github.

Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------

### 1. Project keywords (admin data)

Project keywords need to be transformed into sequences and property
changed to projectKeyword (singular).

before:

    <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>
            knora-base:projectKeywords "images, collection"^^xsd:string .

after:

    <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>
            knora-base:projectKeyword "images"^^xsd:string, "collection"^^xsd:string ;

### 2. Project descriptions (admin data)

Project descriptions need to be transformed into sequences with language
tag.

before:

    <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>
            knora-base:projectDescription "A demo project of a collection of images"^^xsd:string .

after:

    <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>
            knora-base:projectDescription "A demo project of a collection of images"@en .

### 3. salsah-gui:guiOrder

The predicate `salsah-gui:guiOrder` is now attached to cardinalities in
class definitions, instead of attaching it to property definitions. This
allows the same property to be first in one class and last in another
class.

Before:

    :title rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
      salsah-gui:guiOrder "1"^^xsd:integer .

After:

    :book rdf:type owl:Class ;
          rdfs:subClassOf knora-base:Resource ,
                          [
                             rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                             owl:onProperty :title ;
                             owl:minCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
                             salsah-gui:guiOrder "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
                          ]

Existing project-specific ontologies must be updated. You can use the
command-line tool `org/knora/webapi/util/TransformOntology.scala` to do
this automatically. First dump your ontology to a Turtle file. Then at
the `sbt` console, type:

    runMain org.knora.webapi.util.TransformOntology -t guiorder INPUT OUTPUT

For INPUT, use the absolute path of the Turtle file representing your
existing ontology. For OUTPUT, use the absolute path of the output file
to be created.

Note that, because of a limitation of the current version of the RDF4J
Turtle generation library, the generated Turtle represents cardinalities
as labelled blank nodes, rather than as anonymous blank nodes, which
would be more readable (see [this pull
request](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/pull/890)).

Then replace the contents of your ontology's named graph in the
triplestore with the contents of the transformed Turtle file, and
restart Knora. Be sure to test this on a test
installation using a copy of your data and ontologies, before updating
the ontology used by a live server.

Also, you have to replace the `salsah-gui` ontology that you have in the
triplestore with the one in `salsah-gui.ttl`.

New features:
-------------

-   

    General

    :   -   Change: Return differently formatted JSON responses for
            exception messages, depending on which route (`v1`, `v2`\`
            or `admin`) was accessed.

-   

    Admin API

    :   -   Change: Project shortcode is required for the creation of
            new projects
        -   Change: Project keywords are now a sequence. Needs change to
            existing data. Please see example above.
        -   Change: Project description has language tag and is returned
            as array. Needs change to existing data. Please see
            example above.
        -   Change: Remove institution from project (will be added later
            with the FAIR metadata)
        -   Change: Sorting of collections with admin objects (user,
            group, project)
        -   New: Keywords endpoint at `/admin/projects/keywords` returns
            all unique keywords (as strings) for all projects in an
            array
        -   New: Keywords endpoint at
            `/admin/projects/keywords/[projectIri]` returns all keywords
            of a single project.
        -   New: Lists endpoint at `/admin/lists/` allows new lists to
            be created.
        -   New: Lists endpoint at `/admin/lists/infos/<listIri>` allows
            to change basic list information.
