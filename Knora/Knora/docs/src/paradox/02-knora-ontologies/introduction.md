## Resource Description Framework (RDF)

Knora uses a hierarchy of ontologies based on the Resource Description
Framework
([RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/)), RDF
Schema ([RDFS](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf-schema-20140225/)), and
the Web Ontology Language
([OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-quick-reference/)). Both RDFS and OWL
are expressed in RDF. RDF expresses information as a set of statements
(called *triples*). A triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and an
object:

![Figure 1](introduction-fig1.dot.png "Figure 1")

The object may be either a literal value (such as a name or number) or
another subject. Thus it is possible to create complex graphs that
connect many subjects, like this:

![Figure 2](introduction-fig2.dot.png "Figure 2")

In RDF, each subject and predicate has a unique, URL-like identifier
called an Internationalized Resource Identifier
(@extref[IRI](rfc:3987)). Within a given project,
IRIs typically differ only in their last component (the "local part"),
which is often the fragment following a `#` character. Such IRIs share a
long "prefix". In [Turtle](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) and similar
formats for writing RDF, a short prefix label can be defined to
represent the long prefix. Then an IRI can be written as a prefix label
and a local part, separated by a colon (`:`). For example, if the
"example" project's long prefix is `http://www.example.org/rdf#`, and it
contains subjects with IRIs like `http://www.example.org/rdf#book`, we
can define the prefix label `ex` to represent the prefix label, and
write prefixed names for IRIs:

## Built-in Ontologies and Project-specific Ontologies

To ensure the interoperability of data produced by different projects,
each project must describe its data model by creating ontologies that
extend Knora\'s built-in ontologies. The main built-in ontology in Knora
is @ref:[knora-base](knora-base.md).
