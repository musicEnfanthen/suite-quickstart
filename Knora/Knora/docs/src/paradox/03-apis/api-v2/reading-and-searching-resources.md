# Reading and Searching Resources

@@toc

To retrieve an existing resource, the HTTP method `GET` has to be used.
Reading resources may require authentication, since some resources may
have restricted viewing permissions.

## Responses Describing Resources

Resources can be returned in
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/),
[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/),
or [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), using
@extref[HTTP content negotiation](rfc:7231#section-5.3.2) (see
@ref:[Response Formats](introduction.md#response-formats)).

Operations for reading and searching resources can return responses in either the
simple or the complex ontology schema. The complex schema is used by default.
To receive a response in the simple schema, use the HTTP request header or URL
parameter described in @ref:[API Schema](introduction.md#api-schema).

Each Knora API v2 response describing one or more resources returns a
single RDF graph. For example, a request for a single resource returns that
resource and all its values. In a full-text search, the resource is returned with the
values that matched the search criteria. A response to an extended search
may represent a whole graph of interconnected resources.

In JSON-LD, if only one resource is returned, it is the top-level object;
if more than one resource is returned, they are represented as an array
of objects of the `@graph` member of the top-level object (see
[Named Graphs](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#named-graphs) in the
JSON-LD specification).

In the complex schema, dependent resources, i.e. resources that are referred
to by other resources on the top level, are nested in link value objects.

See the interfaces `Resource` and `ResourcesSequence` in module
`ResourcesResponse` (exists for both API schemas: `ApiV2Simple` and
`ApiV2WithValueObjects`).

## Get the Representation of a Resource by its IRI

### Get a Full Representation of a Resource by its IRI

A full representation of resource can be obtained by making a GET
request to the API providing its IRI. Because a Knora IRI has the format
of a URL, its IRI has to be URL-encoded.

To get the resource with the IRI `http://data.knora.org/c5058f3a` (a
book from the sample Incunabula project, which is included in the Knora
API server's test data), make a HTTP GET request to the `resources`
route (path segment `resources` in the API call) and append the
URL-encoded IRI:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resources/http%3A%2F%2Fdata.knora.org%2Fc5058f3a
```

If necessary, several resources can be queried at the same time, their
IRIs separated by slashes. Please note that the amount of resources that
can be queried in one requested is limited. See the settings for
`app/v2` in `application.conf`.

More formally, the URL looks like this:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resources/resourceIRI(/anotherResourceIri)*
```

### Get the preview of a resource by its IRI

In some cases, the client may only want to request the preview of a
resource, which just provides its `rdfs:label` and type.

This works exactly like making a conventional resource request, using
the path segment `resourcespreview`:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resourcespreview/resourceIRI(/anotherResourceIri)*
```

## Search for Resources

### Search for a Resource by its `rdfs:label`

Knora offers the possibility to search for resources by their
`rdfs:label`. The use case for this search is to find a specific
resource as you type. E.g., the user wants to get a list of resources
whose `rdfs:label` contain some search terms separated by a whitespace
character:

   - Zeit
   - Zeitg
   - ...
   - Zeitglöcklein d
   - ...
   - Zeitglöcklein des Lebens

With each character added to the last term, the selection gets more
specific. The first term should at least contain four characters. To
make this kind of "search as you type" possible, a wildcard character is
automatically added to the last search term.

    HTTP GET to http://host/v2/searchbylabel/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI]
    [limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer]

The first parameter must be preceded by a question mark `?`, any
following parameter by an ampersand `&`.

The default value for the parameter `offset` is 0, which returns the
first page of search results. Subsequent pages of results can be fetched
by increasing `offset` by one. The amount of results per page is defined
in `app/v2` in `application.conf`.

For performance reasons, standoff markup is not queried for this route.

To request the number of results rather than the results themselves, you can
do a count query:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/searchbylabel/count/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI][limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer]
```

The response to a count query request is an object with one predicate,
`http://schema.org/numberOfItems`, with an integer value.

### Full-text Search

Knora offers a full-text search that searches through all textual
representations of values and `rdfs:label` of resources. You can
separate search terms by a white space character and they will be
combined using the Boolean `AND` operator. Please note that the search
terms have to be URL-encoded.

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI]
[limitToStandoffClass=standoffClassIri][limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer]
```

The first parameter has to be preceded by a question
mark `?`, any following parameter by an ampersand `&`.

A search value must have a minimal length of three characters (default value) as defined in `app/v2` in `application.conf`.

A search term may contain wildcards. A `?` represents a single character. It has to be URL-encoded as `%3F` since it has a special meaning in the URL syntax. For example, the term `Uniform` can be search for like this:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/Unif%3Frm
```

A `*` represents zero, one or multiple characters. For example, the term `Uniform` can be searched for like this:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/Uni*m
```

The default value for the parameter `offset` is 0 which returns the
first page of search results. Subsequent pages of results can be fetched
by increasing `offset` by one. The amount of results per page is defined
in `app/v2` in `application.conf`.

If the parameter `limitToStandoffClass` is provided, Knora will look for search terms
that are marked up with the indicated standoff class.

To request the number of results rather than the results themselves, you can
do a count query:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/count/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI][limitToStandoffClass=standoffClassIri][limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer]
```

The first parameter has to be preceded by a question
mark `?`, any following parameter by an ampersand `&`.

The response to a count query request is an object with one predicate,
`http://schema.org/numberOfItems`, with an integer value.

### Gravsearch

For more complex queries than a full-text search, Knora offers a query language
called @ref:[Gravsearch: Virtual Graph Search](query-language.md)).

### Support of TEI/XML

To convert standoff markup to TEI/XML, see @ref:[TEI/XML](tei-xml.md).
