# Gravsearch: Virtual Graph Search

@@toc

## Basic Concept

Gravsearch is intended to offer the advantages of SPARQL endpoints
(particularly the ability to perform queries using complex search
criteria) while avoiding their drawbacks in terms of performance and
security (see [The Enduring Myth of the SPARQL
Endpoint](https://daverog.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-enduring-myth-of-the-sparql-endpoint/)).
It also has the benefit of enabling clients to work with a simpler RDF
data model than the one Knora actually uses to store data in the
triplestore, and makes it possible to provide better error-checking.

Rather than being processed directly by the triplestore, a Gravsearch query
is interpreted by Knora, which enforces certain
restrictions on the query, and implements paging and permission
checking. The API server generates SPARQL based on the Gravsearch query
submitted, queries the triplestore, filters the results according to the
user's permissions, and returns each page of query results as a Knora
API response. Thus, Gravsearch is a hybrid between a RESTful API and a
SPARQL endpoint.

A Gravsearch query conforms to a subset of the syntax of a SPARQL
[CONSTRUCT](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct) query, with
some additional restrictions and functionality. In particular, the
variable representing the top-level (or 'main') resource that will
appear in each search result must be identified, statements must be
included to specify the types of the entities being queried, OFFSET is
used to control paging, and `ORDER BY` is used to sort the results.

It is certainly possible to write Gravsearch queries by hand, but we expect
that in general, they will be automatically generated by client
software, e.g. by a client user interface.

## Submitting Gravsearch Queries

The recommended way to submit a Gravsearch query is via HTTP POST:

```
HTTP POST to http://host/v2/searchextended
```

This works like [query via POST directly](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/#query-via-post-direct)
in the [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/): the query
is sent unencoded as the HTTP request message body, in the UTF-8 charset.

It is also possible to submit a Gravsearch query using HTTP GET. The entire
query must be URL-encoded and included as the last element of the URL path:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v2/searchextended/QUERY
```

The response to a Gravsearch query is an RDF graph, which can be requested in various
formats (see @ref:[Responses Describing Resources](reading-and-searching-resources.md#responses-describing-resources)).

To request the number of results rather than the results themselves, you can
do a count query:

```
HTTP POST to http://host/v2/searchextended/count
```

The response to a count query request is an object with one predicate,
`http://schema.org/numberOfItems`, with an integer value.

## Gravsearch and API Schemas

A Gravsearch query can be written in either of the two
@ref:[Knora API v2 schemas](introduction.md#api-schema). The simple schema
is easier to work with, and is sufficient if you don't need to query
anything below the level of a Knora value. If your query needs to refer to
list nodes or standoff markup, you must use the complex schema. Each query must use a single
schema, with one exception (see @ref:[Date Comparisons](#date-comparisons)).

Gravsearch query results can be requested in the simple or complex schema;
see @ref:[API Schema](introduction.md#api-schema).

### Using the Simple Schema

To write a query in the simple schema, use the `knora-api` ontology in
the simple schema, and use the simple schema for any other Knora ontologies
the query refers to, e.g.:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#>
```

In the simple schema, Knora values are represented as literals, which
can be used `FILTER` expressions
(see @ref:[Filtering on Values in the Simple Schema](#filtering-on-values-in-the-simple-schema)).

### Using the Complex Schema

To write a query in the complex schema, use the `knora-api` ontology in
the complex schema, and use the complex schema for any other Knora ontologies
the query refers to, e.g.:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/simple/v2#>
```

In the complex schema, Knora values are represented as objects belonging
to subclasses of `knora-api:Value`, e.g. `knora-api:TextValue`, and have
predicates of their own, which can be used in `FILTER` expressions
(see @ref:[Filtering on Values in the Complex Schema](#filtering-on-values-in-the-complex-schema)).

## Main and Dependent Resources

The main resource is the top-level resource in a search result. Other
resources that are in some way connected to the main resource are
referred to as dependent resources. If the client asks for a resource A
relating to a resource B, then all matches for A will be presented as
main resources and those for B as dependent resources. The main resource
must be represented by a variable, marked with `knora-api:isMainResource`,
as explained under @ref:[CONSTRUCT Clause](#construct-clause).

## Graph Patterns and Result Graphs

The WHERE clause of a Gravsearch query specifies a graph pattern. Each query
result will match this graph pattern, and will have the form of a graph
whose starting point is a main resource. The query's graph pattern, and
hence each query result graph, can span zero more levels of relations
between resources. For example, a query could request regions
in images on pages of books written by a certain author, articles by
authors who were students of a particular professor, or authors of texts
that refer to events that took place within a certain date range.

## Permission Checking

Each matching resource is returned only if the client has permission to
see all the values of that resource that matched the criteria given in
the WHERE clause. If a matching resource contains a value that was
mentioned in the WHERE clause, but the client does not have permission
to see that value, the resource is not returned in the results, and is
instead replaced by a proxy resource called
`knora-api:ForbiddenResource`.

## Inference

Gravsearch queries are understood to imply
[RDFS reasoning](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/). Depending on the
triplestore being used, this may be implemented using the triplestore's
own reasoner or by query expansion in Knora.

This means that if a statement pattern specifies a property, the pattern will
also match subproperties of that property, and if a statement specifies that
a subject has a particular `rdf:type`, the statement will also match subjects
belonging to subclasses of that type.

## Gravsearch Syntax

Every Gravsearch query is a valid SPARQL 1.1
[CONSTRUCT](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct) query.
However, Gravsearch only supports a subset of the elements that can be used
in a SPARQL Construct query, and a Gravsearch
@ref:[CONSTRUCT Clause](#construct-clause) has to indicate which variable
is to be used for the main resource in each search result.

### Supported SPARQL Syntax

The current version of Gravsearch accepts `CONSTRUCT` queries whose `WHERE`
clauses use the following patterns, with the specified restrictions:

  - `OPTIONAL`: cannot be nested in a `UNION`.
  - `UNION`: cannot be nested in a `UNION`.
  - `FILTER`: may contain a complex expression using the Boolean
    operators AND and OR, as well as comparison operators. The left
    argument of a comparison operator must be a query variable.
    A Knora ontology entity IRI used in a `FILTER` must be a property IRI.
  - `FILTER NOT EXISTS`
  - `OFFSET`: the `OFFSET` is needed for paging. It does not actually
    refer to the number of triples to be returned, but to the
    requested page of results. The default value is 0, which refers
    to the first page of results. The number of results per page is
    defined in `app/v2` in `application.conf`.
  - `ORDER BY`: In SPARQL, the result of a `CONSTRUCT` query is an
    unordered set of triples. However, a Gravsearch query returns an
    ordered list of resources, which can be ordered by the values of
    specified properties. If the query is written in the complex schema,
    items below the level of Knora values may not be used in `ORDER BY`.
  - `BIND`: The value assigned must be a Knora resource IRI.

### Resources, Properties, and Values

Resources can be represented either by an IRI or by a variable, except for the
main resource, which must be represented by a variable.

It is possible to do a Gravsearch query in which the IRI of the main resource
is already known, e.g. to request specific information about that resource and
perhaps about linked resources. In this case, the IRI of the main resource must
be assigned to a variable using `BIND`.

Properties can be represented by an IRI or a query variable. If a
property is represented by a query variable, it can be restricted to
certain property IRIs using a `FILTER`.

A Knora value (i.e. a value attached to a `knora-api:Resource`)
must be represented as a query variable.

### Filtering on Values

#### Filtering on Values in the Simple Schema

In the simple schema, a variable representing a Knora value can be used
directly in a `FILTER` expression. For example:

```
?book incunabula:title ?title .
FILTER(?title = "ZeitglÃ¶cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi")
```

Here the type of `?title` is `xsd:string`.

The following Knora value types can be compared with literals in `FILTER`
expressions in the simple schema:

- Text values (`xsd:string`)
- Uri values (`xsd:anyURI`)
- Integer values (`xsd:integer`)
- Decimal values (`xsd:decimal`)
- Boolean values (`xsd:boolean`)
- Date values (`knora-api:Date`)

A Knora value may not be represented as the literal object of a predicate;
for example, this is not allowed:

```
?book incunabula:title "ZeitglÃ¶cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi" .
```

#### Filtering on Values in the Complex Schema

In the complex schema, variables representing Knora values are not literals.
You must add something to the query (generally a statement) to get a literal
from a Knora value. For example:

```
?book incunabula:title ?title .
?title knora-api:valueAsString "ZeitglÃ¶cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi" .
```

Here the type of `?title` is `knora-api:TextValue`. Note that no `FILTER` is needed
in this example. But if you want to use a different comparison operator,
you need a `FILTER`:

```
?page incunabula:seqnum ?seqnum .
?seqnum knora-api:intValueAsInt ?seqnumInt .
FILTER(?seqnumInt <= 10)
```

To match a date value in the complex schema, you must use the
`knora-api:toSimpleDate` function in a `FILTER`
(see @ref:[Date Comparisons](#date-comparisons)). The predicates of
`knora-api:DateValue` (`knora-api:dateValueHasStartYear`, etc.) are not
available in Gravsearch.

#### Date Comparisons

In the simple schema, you can compare a date value directly with a `knora-api:Date`
in a `FILTER`:

```
?book incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .
FILTER(?pubdate < "JULIAN:1497"^^knora-api:Date)
```

In the complex schema, you must use the function `knora-api:toSimpleDate`,
passing it the variable representing the date value. The date literal used
in the comparison must still be a `knora-api:Date` in the simple schema.
This is the only case in which you can use both schemas in a single query:

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api-simple: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?book knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?book incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .
} WHERE {
    ?book a incunabula:book .
    ?book incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .
    FILTER(knora-api:toSimpleDate(?pubdate) < "JULIAN:1497"^^knora-api-simple:Date)
} ORDER BY ?pubdate
```

You can also use `knora-api:toSimpleDate` with to search for date tags in standoff
text markup (see @ref:[Matching Standoff Dates](#matching-standoff-dates)).

#### Searching for Matching Words

The function `knora-api:match` searches for matching words anywhere in a
text value, and is implemented using a full-text search index if available.
The first argument must be a variable of type `xsd:string`, and the second
argument is a string containing the words to be matched, separated by spaces.
The words to be matched are separated by spaces in a string literal.
For example, to search for titles that contain the words 'ZeitglÃ¶cklein' and
'Lebens' in the simple schema:

```
FILTER knora-api:match(?title, "ZeitglÃ¶cklein Lebens")
```

In the complex schema:

```
?title knora-api:valueAsString ?titleStr .
FILTER knora-api:match(?titleStr, "ZeitglÃ¶cklein Lebens")
```

If `knora-api:match` is used in a `FILTER`, it must be the only expression in
the `FILTER`.

#### Filtering Text by Language

To filter a text value by language in the simple schema, use the SPARQL `lang` function
on the text value, e.g.:

```
FILTER(lang(?text) = "fr")
```

In the complex schema, the `lang` function is not supported. Use the text
value's `knora-api:textValueHasLanguage` predicate instead:

```
?text knora-api:textValueHasLanguage "fr" .
```

#### Regular Expressions

The [SPARQL `regex` function](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#func-regex)
is supported. In the simple schema, you can use it directly on the text value,
e.g.

```
?book incunabula:title ?title .
FILTER regex(?title, "Zeit", "i")
```

In the complex schema, use it on the object of the text value's
`knora-api:valueAsString` predicate:

```
?book incunabula:title ?title .
?title knora-api:valueAsString ?titleStr .
FILTER regex(?titleStr, "Zeit", "i")
```

### Searching for Text Markup

To refer to standoff markup in text values, you must write your query in the complex
schema.

A `knora-api:TextValue` can have the property
`knora-api:textValueHasStandoff`, whose objects are the standoff markup
tags in the text. You can match the tags you're interested in using
`rdf:type` or other properties of each tag.

#### Matching Text in a Standoff Tag

The function `knora-api:matchInStandoff` searches for standoff tags containing certain terms.
The implementation is optimised using the full-text search index if available. The
function takes three arguments:

  1. A variable representing the string literal value of a text value.
  2. A variable representing a standoff tag.
  3. A string literal containing space-separated search terms.

This function can only be used as the top-level expression in a `FILTER`.
For example:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#>
PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
} WHERE {
    ?letter a beol:letter .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
    ?text knora-api:valueAsString ?textStr .
    ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffParagraphTag .
    ?standoffParagraphTag a standoff:StandoffParagraphTag .
    FILTER knora-api:matchInStandoff(?textStr, ?standoffParagraphTag, "Grund Richtigkeit")
}
```

Here we are looking for letters containing the words "Grund" and "Richtigkeit"
within a single paragraph.

#### Matching Standoff Links

If you are only interested in specifying that a resource has some text
value containing a standoff link to another resource, the most efficient
way is to use the property `knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo`, whose subjects and objects
are resources. This property is automatically maintained by Knora. For example:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
} WHERE {
    ?letter a beol:letter .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
    ?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person .
    ?person a beol:person .
    ?person beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iafIdentifier .
    ?iafIdentifier knora-api:valueAsString "(VIAF)271899510" .
}
```

Here we are looking for letters containing a link to the historian
Claude Jordan, who is identified by his Integrated Authority File
identifier, `(VIAF)271899510`.

However, if you need to specify the context in which the link tag occurs, you must
use the function `knora-api:standoffLink`. It takes three arguments:

  1. A variable or IRI representing the resource that is the source of the link.
  2. A variable representing the standoff link tag.
  3. A variable or IRI representing the resource that is the target of the link.

This function can only be used as the top-level expression in a `FILTER`.
For example:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#>
PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
} WHERE {
    ?letter a beol:letter .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
    ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffLinkTag .
    ?standoffLinkTag a knora-api:StandoffLinkTag .
    FILTER knora-api:standoffLink(?letter, ?standoffLinkTag, ?person)
    ?person a beol:person .
    ?person beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iafIdentifier .
    ?iafIdentifier knora-api:valueAsString "(VIAF)271899510" .
    ?standoffLinkTag knora-api:standoffTagHasStartParent ?standoffItalicTag .
    ?standoffItalicTag a standoff:StandoffItalicTag .
}
```

This has the same effect as the previous example, except that because we are matching
the link tag itself, we can specify that its immediate parent is a
`StandoffItalicTag`.

If you actually want to get the target of the link (in this example, `?person`)
in the search results, you need to add a statement like
`?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person .` to the `WHERE` clause and to the
`CONSTRUCT` clause:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#>
PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
    ?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person .
} WHERE {
    ?letter a beol:letter .
    ?letter beol:hasText ?text .
    ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffLinkTag .
    ?standoffLinkTag a knora-api:StandoffLinkTag .
    FILTER knora-api:standoffLink(?letter, ?standoffLinkTag, ?person)
    ?person a beol:person .
    ?person beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iafIdentifier .
    ?iafIdentifier knora-api:valueAsString "(VIAF)271899510" .
    ?standoffLinkTag knora-api:standoffTagHasStartParent ?standoffItalicTag .
    ?standoffItalicTag a standoff:StandoffItalicTag .
    ?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person .
}
```

#### Matching Standoff Dates

You can use the `knora-api:toSimpleDate` function (see @ref[Date Comparisons](#date-comparisons))
to match dates in standoff date tags, i.e. instances of `knora-api:StandoffDateTag` or
of one of its subclasses. For example, here we are looking for a text containing
an `anything:StandoffEventTag` (which is a project-specific subclass of `knora-api:StandoffDateTag`)
representing an event that occurred sometime during the month of December 2016:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX anything: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api-simple: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?thing knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?thing anything:hasText ?text .
} WHERE {
    ?thing a anything:Thing .
    ?thing anything:hasText ?text .
    ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffEventTag .
    ?standoffEventTag a anything:StandoffEventTag .
    FILTER(knora-api:toSimpleDate(?standoffEventTag) = "GREGORIAN:2016-12 CE"^^knora-api-simple:Date)
}
```

#### Matching Ancestor Tags

Suppose we want to search for a standoff date in a paragraph, but we know
that the paragraph tag might not be the immediate parent of the date tag.
For example, the date tag might be in an italics tag, which is in a paragraph
tag. In that case, we can use the inferred property
`knora-api:standoffTagHasStartAncestor`. We can modify the previous example to
do this:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#>
PREFIX anything: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api-simple: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?thing knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?thing anything:hasText ?text .
} WHERE {
    ?thing a anything:Thing .
    ?thing anything:hasText ?text .
    ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffDateTag .
    ?standoffDateTag a knora-api:StandoffDateTag .
    FILTER(knora-api:toSimpleDate(?standoffDateTag) = "GREGORIAN:2016-12-24 CE"^^knora-api-simple:Date)
    ?standoffDateTag knora-api:standoffTagHasStartAncestor ?standoffParagraphTag .
    ?standoffParagraphTag a standoff:StandoffParagraphTag .
}
```

### CONSTRUCT Clause

In the `CONSTRUCT` clause of a Gravsearch query, the variable representing the
main resource must be indicated with `knora-api:isMainResource true`. Exactly
one variable representing a resource must be marked in this way.

Any other statements in the `CONSTRUCT` clause must also be present in the WHERE
clause. If a variable representing a resource or value is used in the `WHERE`
clause but not in the `CONSTRUCT` clause, the matching resources or values
will not be included in the results.

If the query is written in the complex schema, all variables in the `CONSTRUCT`
clause must refer to Knora resources, Knora values, or properties. Data below
the level of Knora values may not be mentioned in the `CONSTRUCT` clause.

Predicates from the `rdf`, `rdfs`, and `owl` ontologies may not be used
in the `CONSTRUCT` clause. The `rdfs:label` of each matching resource is always
returned, so there is no need to mention it in the query.

## Gravsearch by Example

In this section, we provide some sample queries of different complexity
to illustrate the usage of Gravsearch.

### Getting All the Components of a Compound Resource

In order to get all the components of a compound resource, the following
Gravsearch query can be sent to the API.

In this case, the compound resource is an `incunabula:book` identified
by the IRI `http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a` and the components are of
type `incunabula:page` (test data for the Incunabula project). Since
inference is assumed, we can use `knora-api:StillImageRepresentation`
(`incunabula:page` is one of its subclasses). This makes the query more
generic and allows for reuse (for instance, a client would like to query
different types of compound resources defined in different ontologies).

`ORDER BY` is used to sort the components by their sequence number.

`OFFSET` is set to 0 to get the first page of results.

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
   ?component knora-api:isMainResource true . # marking of the component searched for as the main resource, required
   ?component knora-api:seqnum ?seqnum . # return the sequence number in the response
   ?component knora-api:hasStillImageFileValue ?file . # return the StillImageFile in the response
} WHERE {
   ?component a knora-api:StillImageRepresentation . # restriction of the type of component
   ?component knora-api:isPartOf <http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a> . # component relates to a compound resource via this property
   ?component knora-api:seqnum ?seqnum . # component must have a sequence number
   ?component knora-api:hasStillImageFileValue ?file . # component must have a StillImageFile
}
ORDER BY ASC(?seqnum) # order by sequence number, ascending
OFFSET 0 # get first page of results
```

The `incunabula:book` with the IRI `http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a` has
402 pages. (This result can be obtained by doing a count query; see
@ref:[Submitting Gravsearch Queries](#submitting-gravsearch-queries).)
However, with `OFFSET 0`, only the first page of results is returned.
The same query can be sent again with `OFFSET 1` to get the next page of
results, and so forth. When a page of results is not full (see settings
in `app/v2` in `application.conf`) or is empty, no more results are
available.

By design, it is not possible for the client to get more than one page
of results at a time; this is intended to prevent performance problems
that would be caused by huge responses. A client that wants to download
all the results of a query must request each page sequentially.

Let's assume the client is not interested in all of the book's pages,
but just in first ten of them. In that case, the sequence number can be
restricted using a `FILTER` that is added to the query's `WHERE` clause:

```
FILTER (?seqnum <= 10)
```

The first page starts with sequence number 1, so with this `FILTER` only
the first ten pages are returned.

This query would be exactly the same in the complex schema, except for
the expansion of the `knora-api` prefix:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
```

### Traversing Multiple Links

Here we are looking for regions of pages that are part of books that have a
particular title. In the simple schema:

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
  ?region knora-api:isMainResource true ;
    knora-api:isRegionOf ?page .

  ?page incunabula:partOf ?book .

  ?book incunabula:title ?title .
} WHERE {
  ?region a knora-api:Region ;
    knora-api:isRegionOf ?page .

  ?page a incunabula:page ;
    incunabula:partOf ?book .

  ?book incunabula:title ?title .

  FILTER(?title = "ZeitglÃ¶cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi")
}
```

In the complex schema:

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
  ?region knora-api:isMainResource true ;
    knora-api:isRegionOf ?page .

  ?page incunabula:partOf ?book .

  ?book incunabula:title ?title .
} WHERE {
  ?region a knora-api:Region ;
    knora-api:isRegionOf ?page .

  ?page a incunabula:page ;
    incunabula:partOf ?book .

  ?book incunabula:title ?title .

  ?title knora-api:valueAsString "ZeitglÃ¶cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi" .
}
```

If we remove the line `?book incunabula:title ?title .` from the `CONSTRUCT`
clause, so that the `CONSTRUCT` clause no longer mentions `?title`, the response
will contain the same matching resources, but the titles of those resources
will not be included in the response.

### Requesting a Graph Starting with a Known Resource

Here the IRI of the main resource is already known, and we want specific information
about it, as well as about related resources. In this case, the IRI of the main
resource must be assigned to a variable using `BIND`:

```
PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/simple/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
  ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true ;
    beol:creationDate ?date ;
    ?linkingProp1 ?person1 .

  ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?familyName .
} WHERE {
  BIND(<http://rdfh.ch/0801/_B3lQa6tSymIq7_7SowBsA> AS ?letter)

  ?letter a beol:letter ;
    beol:creationDate ?date ;
    ?linkingProp1 ?person1 .

  FILTER(?linkingProp1 = beol:hasAuthor || ?linkingProp1 = beol:hasRecipient)

  ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?familyName .
} ORDER BY ?date
```

This query would be the same in the complex schema, except for the prefix
expansions:

```
PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
```

### Searching for a List Value Referring to a Particular List Node

This is possible only in the complex schema:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#>
PREFIX anything: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?thing knora-api:isMainResource true .
    ?thing anything:hasListItem ?listItem .
} WHERE {
    ?thing anything:hasListItem ?listItem .
    ?listItem knora-api:listValueAsListNode <http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/treeList02> .
}
```

## Type Inference

Gravsearch needs to be able to determine the types of the entities that
query variables and IRIs refer to in the `WHERE` clause. In most cases, it can
infer these from context and from the ontologies used. In particular, it needs to
know:

* The type of the subject and object of each statement.
* The type that is expected as the object of each predicate.

### Type Annotations

When one or more types cannot be inferred, Gravsearch will return an error message
indicating the entities for which it could not determine types. The missing
information must then be given by adding type annotations to the query. This can always done by
adding statements with the predicate `rdf:type`. The subject must be a resource or value,
and the object must either be `knora-api:Resource` (if the subject is a resource)
or the subject's specific type (if it is a value).

For example, consider this query that uses a non-Knora property:

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ;
        dcterms:title ?title .

} WHERE {
    ?book dcterms:title ?title .
}
```

This produces the error message:

```
The types of one or more entities could not be determined:
  ?book, <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title>, ?title
```

To solve this problem, it is enough to specify the types of `?book` and
`?title`; the type of the expected object of `dcterms:title` can then be inferred
from the type of `?title`.

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ;
        dcterms:title ?title .

} WHERE {

    ?book rdf:type incunabula:book ;
        dcterms:title ?title .

    ?title rdf:type xsd:string .

}
```

It would also be possible to annotate the property itself, using the predicate `knora-api:objectType`;
then the type of `?title` would be inferred:

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ;
        dcterms:title ?title .

} WHERE {

    ?book rdf:type incunabula:book ;
        dcterms:title ?title .

    dcterms:title knora-api:objectType xsd:string .

}
```

Note that it only makes sense to use `dcterms:title` in the simple schema, because
its object is supposed to be a literal.

Here is another example, using a non-Knora class:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?person knora-api:isMainResource true .
} WHERE {
    ?person a foaf:Person .
    ?person foaf:familyName ?familyName .
    FILTER(?familyName = "Meier")
}
```

This produces the error message:

```
Types could not be determined for one or more entities: ?person
```

The solution is to specify that `?person` is a `knora-api:Resource`:

```
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?person knora-api:isMainResource true .
} WHERE {
    ?person a foaf:Person .
    ?person a knora-api:Resource .
    ?person foaf:familyName ?familyName .
    FILTER(?familyName = "Meier")
}
```

### Inconsistent Types

Gravsearch will also reject a query if an entity is used with inconsistent types.
For example:

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ;
        incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .
} WHERE {
    ?book a incunabula:book ;
        incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .

  FILTER(?pubdate = "JULIAN:1497-03-01") .
}
```

This returns the error message:

```
One or more entities have inconsistent types:

<http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#pubdate>
  knora-api:objectType <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#Date> ;
  knora-api:objectType <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

?pubdate rdf:type <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#Date> ;
  rdf:type <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .
```

This is because the `incunabula` ontology says that the object of `incunabula:pubdate` must be a `knora-api:Date`,
but the `FILTER` expression compares `?pubdate` with an `xsd:string`. The solution is to specify the
type of the literal in the `FILTER`:

```
PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#>
PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#>

CONSTRUCT {
    ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ;
        incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .
} WHERE {
    ?book a incunabula:book ;
        incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .

  FILTER(?pubdate = "JULIAN:1497-03-01"^^knora-api:Date) .
}
```
