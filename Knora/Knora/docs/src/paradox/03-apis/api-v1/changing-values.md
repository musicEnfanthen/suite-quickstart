# Changing a Value

To add values to an existing resource, the HTTP method `PUT`
has to be used. Changing values requires authentication since only known
users may change values.

## Modifying a Property Value

The request has to be sent to the Knora server using the `values` path
segment followed by the value's IRI:

```
HTTP PUT to http://host/values/valueIRI
```

The value IRI has to be URL-encoded.

To change an existing value (creating a new version of it), the
value's current IRI and its new value have to be submitted as JSON in
the HTTP body.

Depending on the type of the new value, one of the following formats
has to be used in order to create a new value (all these TypeScript interfaces are defined in module `changeValueFormats`):
    
* `changeRichtextValueRequest`
* `changeLinkValueRequest`
* `changeIntegerValueRequest`
* `changeDecimalValueRequest`
* `changeBooleanValueRequest`
* `changeUriValueRequest`
* `changeDateValueRequest`
* `changeColorValueRequest`
* `changeGeometryValueRequest`
* `changeHierarchicalListValueRequest`
* `changeIntervalValueRequest`
* `changeGeonameValueRequest`

## Modifying a File Value

In order to exchange a file value (digital representation of a
resource), the path segment `filevalue` has to be used. The IRI of the
resource whose file value is to be exchanged has to be appended:

```
HTTP PUT to http://host/filevalue/resourceIRI
```

Please note that the resource IRI has to be URL encoded.

There are two ways to change a file of a resource: Either by submitting
directly the binaries of the file in a HTTP Multipart request or by
indicating the location of the file. The two cases are referred to as
non-GUI case and GUI case (TODO: add a link to "Sipi and Knora").

### Including the binaries (non-GUI case)

Here, a HTTP MULTIPART request has to be made simply providing the
binaries (without JSON):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests, json, urllib

# the name of the file to be submitted
filename = 'myimage.tif'

# a tuple containing the file's name, its binaries and its mimetype
files = {'file': (filename, open(filename, 'rb'), "image/tiff")}

resIri = urllib.parse.quote_plus('http://data.knora.org/xy')

r = requests.put("http://host/filevalue/" + resIri,
                 files=files)
```

Please note that the file has to be read in binary mode (by default it
would be read in text mode).

### Indicating the location of a file (GUI case)

Here, simply the location of the new file has to be submitted as JSON.
The JSON format is described in the TypeScript interface
`changeFileValueRequest` in module `changeValueFormats`. The request
header's content type has to set to `application/json`.

## Response on Value Change

When a value has been successfully changed, Knora sends back a JSON with
the new value's IRI. The value IRI identifies the value and can be used
to perform future Knora API V1 operations.

The JSON format of the response is described in the TypeScript interface
`changeValueResponse` in module `changeValueFormats`.
