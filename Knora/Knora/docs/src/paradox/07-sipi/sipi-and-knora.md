# Interaction Between Sipi and Knora

## General Remarks

Knora and Sipi (Simple Image Presentation Interface) are two
**complementary** software projects. Whereas Knora deals with data that
is written to and read from a triplestore (metadata and annotations),
Sipi takes care of storing, converting and serving image files as well
as other types of files such as audio, video, or documents (binary files
it just stores and serves).

Knora and Sipi stick to a clear division of responsibility regarding
files: Knora knows about the names of files that are attached to
resources as well as some metadata and is capable of creating the URLs
for the client to request them from Sipi, but the whole handling of
files (storing, naming, organization of the internal directory
structure, format conversions, and serving) is taken care of by Sipi.

## Adding Files to Knora: Using the GUI or directly the API

To create a resource with a digital representation attached to, either
the browser-based GUI (SALSAH) can be used or this can be done by
*directly* addressing the API. (Of course, also the GUI uses the API.
But the user does not need to know about it.) The same applies for
changing an existing digital representation for a resource. Subsequently, the first
case will be called the *GUI case* and the second the *non-GUI case*.

### GUI Case

In this case, the user may choose a file to upload using his
web-browser. The file is directly sent to Sipi (route:
`create_thumbnail`) to calculate a thumbnail hosted by Sipi which then
gets displayed to the user in the browser. Sipi copies the original file
into a temporary directory and keeps it there (for later processing in
another request). In its answer (JSON), Sipi returns:

- `preview_path`: the path to the thumbnail (accessible to a
  web-browser)
- `filename`: the name of the temporarily stored original file
  (managed by Sipi)
- `original_mimetype`: mime type of the original file
- `original_filename`: the original name of the file submitted by
  the client

Once the user finally wants to attach the file to a resource, the
request is sent to Knora's API providing all the required parameters to
create the resource along with additional information about the file to
be attached. **However, the file itself is not submitted to the Knora
Api, but its filename returned by Sipi (from the `create_thumbnail`
response).**

#### Create a new Resource with a Digital Representation

The POST request is handled in `ResourcesRouteV1.scala` and parsed to a
`CreateResourceApiRequestV1`. Information about the file is sent
separately from the other resource parameters (properties) under the
name `file`:

- `originalFilename`: original name of the file (returned by Sipi
  when creating the thumbnail)
- `originalMimeType`: original mime type of the file (returned by
  Sipi when creating the thumbnail)
- `filename`: name of the temporarily stored original file (returned
  by Sipi when creating the thumbnail)

In the route, a `SipiResponderConversionFileRequestV1` is created
representing the information about the file to be attached to the new
resource. Along with the other parameters, it is sent to the resources
responder.

See @ref:[Further Handling of the GUI and the non GUI-case in the Resources Responder](#further-handling-of-the-gui-and-the-non-gui-case-in-the-resources-responder) for
details of how the resources responder then handles the request.

#### Change the Digital Representation of a Resource

The request is taken care of in `ValuesRouteV1.scala`. The PUT request
is handled in path `v1/filevalue/{resIri}` which receives the resource
Iri as a part of the URL: *The submitted file will update the existing
file values of the given resource.*

The file parameters are submitted as json and are parsed into a
`ChangeFileValueApiRequestV1`. To represent the conversion request for
the Sipi responder, a `SipiResponderConversionFileRequestV1` is created.
A `ChangeFileValueRequestV1` containing the resource Iri and the message
for Sipi is then created and sent to the values responder.

See @ref:[Further Handling of the GUI and the non GUI-case in the Values Responder](#further-handling-of-the-gui-and-the-non-gui-case-in-the-values-responder)
for details of how the values responder then handles the request.

### Non-GUI case

In this case, the API receives an HTTP multipart request containing the
binary data.

#### Create a new Resource with a Digital Representation

The request is handled in `ResourcesRouteV1.scala`. The multipart POST
request consists of two named body parts: `json` containing the resource
parameters (properties) and `file` containing the binary data as well as
the file name and its mime type. Using Python's [request
module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#post-a-multipart-encoded-file),
a request could look like this:

```python
import requests, json

params = {...} // resource parameters
files = {'file': (filename, open(path + filename, 'rb'), mimetype)} // filename, binary data, and mime type

r = requests.post(knora_url + '/resources',
                  data={'json': json.dumps(params)},
                  files=files,
                  headers=None)
```

The binary data is saved to a temporary location by Knora. The route
then creates a `SipiResponderConversionPathRequestV1` representing the
information about the file (i.e. the temporary path to the file) to be
attached to the new resource. Along with the other parameters, it is
sent to the resources responder.

See @ref:[Further Handling of the GUI and the non GUI-case in the Resources Responder](#further-handling-of-the-gui-and-the-non-gui-case-in-the-resources-responder) for
details of how the resources responder then handles the request.

#### Change the Digital Representation of a Resource

The request is taken care of in `ValuesRouteV1.scala`. The multipart PUT
request is handled in path `v1/filevalue/{resIri}` which receives the
resource Iri as a part of the URL: *The submitted file will update the
existing file values of the given resource.*

For the request, no json parameters are required. So its body just
consists of the binary data
(see @ref:[Create a new Resource with a Digital Representation](#create-a-new-resource-with-a-digital-representation)).
The values route stores the submitted
binaries as a temporary file and creates a
`SipiResponderConversionPathRequestV1`. A `ChangeFileValueRequestV1`
containing the resource Iri and the message for Sipi is then created and
sent to the values responder.

See @ref:[Further Handling of the GUI and the non GUI-case in the Values Responder](#further-handling-of-the-gui-and-the-non-gui-case-in-the-values-responder) for details
of how the values responder then handles the request.

### Further Handling of the GUI and the Non-GUI case in the Resources Responder

Once a `SipiResponderConversionFileRequestV1` (GUI case) or a
`SipiResponderConversionPathRequestV1` (non-GUI case) has been created
and passed to the resources responder, the GUI and the non-GUI case can
be handled in a very similar way. This is why they are both
implementations of the trait `SipiResponderConversionRequestV1`.

The resource responder calls the ontology responder to check if all
required properties were submitted for the given resource type. Also it
is checked if the given resource type may have a digital representation.
The resources responder then sends a message to Sipi responder that does
a request to the Sipi server. Depending on the type of the message
(`SipiResponderConversionFileRequestV1` or
`SipiResponderConversionPathRequestV1`), a different Sipi route is
called. In the first case (GUI case), the file is already managed by
Sipi and only the filename has to be indicated. In the latter case, Sipi
is told about the location where Knora has saved the binary data to.

To make this handling easy for Knora, both messages have their own
implementation for creating the parameters for Sipi (declared in the
trait as `toFormData`). If Knora deals with a
`SipiResponderConversionPathRequestV1`, it has to delete the temporary
file after it has been processed by SIPI. Here, we assume that we deal
with an image.

For both cases, Sipi returns the same answer containing the following
information:

   - `file_type`: the type of the file that has been handled by Sipi
     (image | video | audio | text | binary)
   - `mimetype_full` and `mimetype_thumb`: mime types of the full image
     representation and the thumbnail
   - `original_mimetype`: the mime type of the original file
   - `original_filename`: the name of the original file
   - `nx_full`, `ny_full`, `nx_thumb`, and `ny_thumb`: the x and y
     dimensions of both the full image and the thumbnail
   - `filename_full` and `filename_full`: the names of the full image
     and the thumbnail (needed to request the images from Sipi)

The `file_type` is important because representations for resources are
restricted to media types: image, audio, video or a generic binary file.
If a resource type requires an image representations (subclass of
`StillImageRepresentation`), the `file_type` has to be an image.
Otherwise, the ontology's restrictions would be violated. Because of
this requirement, there is a construct `fileType2FileValueProperty`
mapping file types to file value properties. Also all the possible file
types are defined in enumeration.

Depending on the given file type, Sipi responder can create the apt
message (here: `StillImageFileValueV1`) to save the data to the
triplestore.

### Further Handling of the GUI and the non-GUI case in the Values Responder

In the values responder, `ChangeFileValueRequestV1` is passed to the
method `changeFileValueV1`. Unlike ordinary value change requests, the
Iris of the value objects to be updated are not known yet. Because of
this, all the existing file values of the given resource Iri have to be
queried first. Also their quality levels are queried because in case of
a `StillImageFileValue`, we have to deal with a file value for the
thumbnail and another one for the full quality representation. When
these two file values are being updated, the quality levels have to be
considered for the sake of consistency (otherwise a full quality value's
`knora-base:previous-value` may point to a thumbnail file value).

With the file values being returned, we actually know about the current
Iris of the value objects. Now the Sipi responder is called to handle
the file conversion request (see @ref:[Further Handling of the GUI and the non GUI-case in the Resources Responder](#further-handling-of-the-gui-and-the-non-gui-case-in-the-resources-responder)).
After that, it is checked that the `file_type` returned by Sipi responder
corresponds to the property type of the existing file values. For
example, if the `file_type` is an image, the property pointing to the
current file values must be a `hasStillImageFileValue`. Otherwise, the
user submitted a non image file that has to be rejected.

Depending on the `file_type`, messages of type `ChangeValueRequestV1`
can be created. For each existing file value, such a message is
instantiated containing the current value Iri and the new value to be
created (returned by the sipi responder). These messages are passed to
`changeValueV1` because with the described handling done in
`changeFileValueV1`, the file values can be changed like any other value
type.

In case of success, a `ChangeFileValueResponseV1` is sent back to the
client, containing a list of the single `ChangeValueResponseV1`.

## Retrieving Files from Sipi

### URL creation

Binary representions of Knora locations are served by Sipi. For each
file value, Knora creates several locations representing different
quality levels:

```
"resinfo": {
   "locations": [
      {
         "duration": â0,
         "nx": â95,
         "path": "http://sipiserver:port/knora/incunabula_0000000002.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg",
         "ny": â128,
         "fps": â0,
         "format_name": "JPEG",
         "origname": "ad+s167_druck1=0001.tif",
         "protocol": "file"
      },
      {
         "duration": â0,
          "nx": â82,
          "path": "http://sipiserver:port/knora/incunabula_0000000002.jp2/full/82,110/0/default.jpg",
          "ny": â110,
          "fps": â0,
          "format_name": "JPEG2000",
          "origname": "ad+s167_druck1=0001.tif",
          "protocol": "file"
      },
      {
          "duration": â0,
          "nx": â163,
          "path": "http://sipiserver:port/knora/incunabula_0000000002.jp2/full/163,219/0/default.jpg",
          "ny": â219,
          "fps": â0,
          "format_name": "JPEG2000",
          "origname": "ad+s167_druck1=0001.tif",
          "protocol": "file"
      }
      ...
   ],
"restype_label": "Seite",
"resclass_has_location": true,
```

Each of these paths has to be handled by the browser by making a call to
Sipi, obtaining the binary representation in the desired quality. To
deal with different image quality levels, Sipi implements the [IIIF
standard](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/). The different quality level
paths are created by Knora in `ValueUtilV1`.

Whenever Sipi serves a binary representation of a Knora file value
(indicated by using the prefix `knora` in the path), it has to make a
request to Knora's Sipi responder to get the user's permissions on the
requested file. Sipi's request to Knora contains a cookie with the Knora
session id the user has obtained when logging in to Knora: As a response
to a successful login, Knora returns the user's session id and this id
is automatically sent to Sipi by the browser, setting a second cookie
for the communication with Sipi. The reason the Knora session id is set
in two cookies, is the fact that cookies can not be shared among
different domains. Since Knora and Sipi are likely to be running under
different domains, this solution offers the necessary flexibility.

### Sharing the Session ID with Sipi

Whenever a file is requested, Sipi asks Knora about the currents user's
permissions on the given file. This is achieved by sharing the Knora
session id with Sipi. When the user logs in to Knora using his browser,
a request is sent to Sipi submitting the session id the user got back
from Knora, setting a second session cookie. Now the user has two
session cookies containing the same session id: one for the
communication with Knora and one for the communication with Sipi.
However, Sipi does not handle sessions. It just sends the given Knora
session id to Knora.
