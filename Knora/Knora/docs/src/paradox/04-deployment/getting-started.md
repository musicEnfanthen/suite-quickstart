# Getting Started with Knora

There is a quick installation guide [here](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/wiki/Quick-Installation-Guide-for-Knora,-Salsah,-Sipi-and-GraphDB).

## Choosing and Setting Up a Triplestore

Knora requires a standards-compliant
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) triplestore. A number of
triplestore implementations are available, including [free
software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) as well as
proprietary options.

Knora is designed to work with any standards-compliant
triplestore. It is primarily tested with [Ontotext
GraphDB](http://ontotext.com/products/graphdb/), a high-performance,
proprietary triplestore. We recommend GraphDB Standard Edition, but
GraphDB Free (which is proprietary but available free of charge) also
works.

Knora includes support for [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/),
which is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html),
but use of Jena is deprecated, and support for it will probably be
removed in the future.

Built-in support and configuration for other triplestores is planned.

See the chapters on @ref:[Starting GraphDB](../05-internals/development/graphdb.md) and
@ref:[Starting Fuseki](../05-internals/development/fuseki.md) for more details.

### Creating Repositories and Loading Test Data

To create a test repository called `knora-test` and load test data into
it, go to `webapi/scripts` and run the script for the triplestore you
have chosen.

  -   - For GraphDB SE:

          - If you are running GraphDB directly from its installation
            directory (using its `graphdb` script), run
            `graphdb-se-local-init-knora-test.sh`.
          - If you are running GraphDB from a Docker image, run
            `graphdb-se-docker-init-knora-test.sh`.

  -   - For GraphDB Free:

          - Configuration is currently provided only for running GraphDB
            Free in Docker. To create a test repository, run
            `graphdb-free-init-knora-test.sh`

  - For Fuseki, run `fuseki-load-test-data.sh`.

You can create your own scripts based on these scripts, to create new
repositories and optionally to load existing Knora-compliant RDF data
into them.

If you are using GraphDB, you must create your repository using a
repository configuration file that specifies the file `KnoraRules.pie`
as its `owlim:ruleset`. This enables RDFS inference and Knora-specific
consistency rules. When using GraphDB, Knora uses RDFS
inference to improve query performance. The Knora-specific consistency
rules help ensure that your data is internally consistent and conforms
to the Knora ontologies.

When testing with GraphDB, you may sometimes get an error when loading
the test data that says that there are multiple IDs for the same
repository `knora-test`. In that case, something went wrong when
dropping and recreating the repository. You can solve this by deleting
the repository manually and starting over. **Make sure you don't delete
important data.** To delete the repository, stop GraphDB, delete the
`data` directory in your GraphDB installation, and restart GraphDB.

## Creating a Test Installation

### Run a supported triplestore

See the chapters on @ref:[Starting GraphDB](../05-internals/development/graphdb.md) and
@ref:[Starting Fuseki](../05-internals/development/fuseki.md) on how to start a supported
triplestore.

### Creating and running the WEBAPI Server distribution package

To create a deployment package for the WEBAPI Server, please run from
inside the `knora/webapi` folder the following commands:

    $ sbt stage
    $ cd target/universal/stage
    $ ./bin/webapi

### Downloading and running Sipi

Download [Sipi](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Sipi) and
install from source by following the
[Sipi Manual](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Sipi/documentation/index.html).
For running and setting up Sipi for Knora, please see
@ref:[The Sipi Media Server](../07-sipi/index.md).

## Transforming Data When Ontologies Change

When there is a change in Knora's ontologies or in a project-specific
ontology, it may be necessary to update existing data to conform to the
new ontology. This can be done directly in SPARQL, but for simple
transformations, Knora includes a command-line program that works on RDF
data files in [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) format. You can
run it from SBT:

```
    > runMain org.knora.webapi.util.TransformData --help
    [info] Running org.knora.webapi.util.TransformData --help
    [info]
    [info] Updates the structure of Knora repository data to accommodate changes in Knora.
    [info]
    [info] Usage: org.knora.webapi.util.TransformData -t [deleted|permissions|strings|standoff|all] input output
    [info]
    [info]   -t, --transform  <arg>   Selects a transformation. Available transformations:
    [info]                            'deleted' (adds missing 'knora-base:isDeleted'
    [info]                            statements), 'permissions' (combines old-style
    [info]                            multiple permission statements into single permission
    [info]                            statements), 'strings' (adds missing valueHasString),
    [info]                            'standoff' (transforms old-style standoff into
    [info]                            new-style standoff), 'creator' (transforms existing
    [info]                            'knora-base:Owner' group inside permissions to
    [info]                            'knora-base:Creator'), 'owner' (gives
    [info]                            'knora-base:Creator' CR permissions to correspond to
    [info]                            the previous behaviour for owners - use with care as
    [info]                            it will add permissions that where not there before),
    [info]                            'all' (all of the above minus 'owner')
    [info]       --help               Show help message
    [info]
    [info]  trailing arguments:
    [info]   input (required)    Input Turtle file
    [info]   output (required)   Output Turtle file
```

The currently available transformations are:

  - deleted  
    Adds `knora-base:isDeleted false` to resources and values that don't
    have a `knora-base:isDeleted` predicate.

  - permissions  
    Combines old-style permission statements (`hasViewPermission`,
    `hasModifyPermission`, etc.) into one `hasPermissions` statement per
    resource or value, as described in @ref:[Permissions](../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#permissions).

  - strings  
    Adds missing `valueHasString` statements to Knora value objects.

  - standoff  
    Transforms old-style standoff markup (containing tag names as
    strings) to new-style standoff markup (using different OWL class
    names for different tags).

  - creator  
    Transforms existing `knora-base:Owner` group inside permissions to
    `knora-base:Creator`.

  - owner  
    Gives `knora-base:Creator` **CR permissions** to correspond to the
    previous behaviour for owners. Use with care as it will add
    permissions that where not there before.

  - all  
    Runs all of the above transformations.

Transformations that are not needed have no effect, so it is safe to use
`-t all`.

The program uses the Turtle parsing and formatting library from
[RDF4J](http://rdf4j.org/). Additional transformations can be
implemented as subclasses of `org.eclipse.rdf4j.rio.RDFHandler`.

## Selectively Disabling Routes

In `application.conf` the setting `app.routes-to-reject` contains a list
of strings, representing routes which should be rejected.

For Example, the string `"v1/users"` would lead to rejection of any
route which contains this string.

## Startup Flags

There is a number of flags that can be set on startup, they will
override any value set in the application configuration file:

  - `loadDemoData`, `--loadDemoData`, `-d`: Loads the demo data.
  - `allowReloadOverHTTP`, `--allow-reload-over-http`, `-r`: Allows
    reloading of data over HTTP.
  - `-p`: Starts the Prometheus monitoring reporter.
  - `-z`: Starts the Zipkin monitoring reporter.
  - `-j`: Starts the Jaeger monitoring reporter.
  - `-c`: Print the configuration at startup.
  - `--help`: Shows the help message with all startup flags.
