# Starting GraphDB

## GraphDB SE

Inside the Knora git repository, there is a folder called
`/triplestores/graphdb-se` containing the latest supported version of
the GraphDB-SE distribution archive.

### Running Locally

Unzip `graphdb-se-x.x.x-dist.zip` to a place of your choosing and run
the following:

    $ cd /to/unziped/location
    $ ./bin/graphdb -Dgraphdb.license.file=/path/to/GRAPHDB_SE.license

### Running inside Docker

#### Important Steps

To be able to successfully run GraphDB inside docker two important steps
need to be done beforhand:

1.  Install Docker from <http://docker.com>.
2.  Copy the GraphDB-SE license file into a folder of you choosing and
    name it `GRAPHDB_SE.license`. We will mount this folder into the
    docker container, so that the license can be used by GraphDB
    running inside the container.

#### Usage

```
$ docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/license/folder:/external -p 7200:7200 dhlabbasel/graphdb
```

  - `--rm` removes the container as soon as you stop it
  - `-p` forwards the exposed port to your host (or if you use
    boot2docker to this IP)
  - `-it` allows interactive mode, so you see if something gets
    deployed

After the GraphDB inside the docker container has started, you can find
the GraphDB workbench here: <http://localhost:7200>

Above, we create and start a transient container (`--rm` flag). To
create a container that we can stop and start again at a later time,
follow the following steps:

```
$ docker run --name graphdb -d -t -v /path/to/license/folder:/external -p 7200:7200 dhlabbasel/graphdb

(to see the console output, attach to the container; to detach press Ctrl-c)
$ docker attach graphdb

(to stop the container)
$ docker stop graphdb

(to start the container again)
$ docker start graphdb

(to remove the container; needs to be stopped)
$ docker rm graphdb
```

  - `--name` give the container a name
  - `-d` run container in background and print container ID
  - `-t` allocate a pseudo TTY, so you see the console output
  - `-p` forwards the exposed port to your host

## GraphDB Free

You can run GraphDB Free locally as described for GraphDB SE above, or
you can use Knora's pre-built GraphDB Free Docker image:

```
$ docker run --rm -p 7200:7200 dhlabbasel/graphdb-free
```
