# Testing

Prerequisite: Before running any tests, a supported triplestore needs to
be started and initialized through a script inside the "scripts" folder.
For example, when using "GraphDB Free", the nedded script is
"graphdb-free-init-knora-test-unit.sh". Please note the occurrence of
"test-unit" in the name of the script.

## How to Write Unit Tests

1)  Inside a test, at the beginning, add the following (change the paths
    to the test data as needed):

```scala
val rdfDataObjects = List (
       RdfDataObject(path = "_test_data/responders.v1.ValuesResponderV1Spec/incunabula-data.ttl", name = "http://www.knora.org/data/incunabula")
)

"Load test data" in {
    storeManager ! ResetTriplestoreContent(rdfDataObjects)
    expectMsg(300.seconds, ResetTriplestoreContentACK())

    responderManager ! LoadOntologiesRequest(SharedTestDataV1.rootUser)
    expectMsg(10.seconds, LoadOntologiesResponse())
}
```

These tests should be stored inside the `src/test` folder hierarchy.

2)  Call the test from SBT:

```
sbt:webapi> test // when using a GraphDB-SE or GraphDB-Free
```

## How to Write Integration Tests

The only difference between Integration and Unit tests is the location
where they are stored and the way how they are called:

1)  Store tests inside the `src/it` folder hierarchy.
2)  Call the tests from SBT: `sbt:webapi> it:test`

## How to Write Performance / Simulation Tests

1)  Store the performance and simulation tests inside the `src/test` and
    the `src/it` folder hierarchy.
2)  To call them, execute either `gatling:test` or `gatling-it:test`
    from inside SBT.

Bellow is an example of an simulation calling the `/admin/users`
endpoint. The simulation ramps up 1000 users over 5 seconds, all
accessing the `/admin/users`
endpoint.
