  - SBT
  - Using GraphDB for development and how to initialize the
    'knora-test-unit' repository
  - Using Fuseki for development

## Building and Running

### Starting a Triplestore

Start a triplestore (GraphDB-Free or GraphDB-SE). Download distribution from [Ontotext](http://ontotext.com). Unzip distribution
 to a place of your choosing and run the following:

```
$ cd /to/unziped/location
$ ./bin/graphdb -Dgraphdb.license.file=/path/to/GRAPHDB_SE.license
```

Here we use GraphDB-SE which needs to be licensed separately.

Then in another terminal, initialize the data repository and load some test data:

```
$ cd KNORA_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/webapi/scripts
$ ./graphdb-se-local-init-knora-test.sh
```

Then go back to the webapi root directory and use SBT to start the API
server:

```
$ cd KNORA_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/webapi
$ sbt
> compile
> reStart
```

To shut down Knora:

```
> re-stop
```

## Running the automated tests

Make sure you've started the triplestore as shown above.

Then in another terminal, initialise the repository used for automated
testing:

```
$ cd KNORA_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/webapi/scripts
$ ./graphdb-se-local-init-knora-test-unit.sh
```

Run the automated tests from sbt:

```
> graphdb:test
```

## Load Testing on Mac OS X

To test Knora with many concurrent connections on Mac OS
X, you will need to adjust some kernel parameters to allow more open
connections, to recycle ephemeral ports more quickly, and to use a wider
range of ephemeral port numbers. The script
`webapi/scripts/macOS-kernel-test-config.sh` will do this.

## Continuous Integration

For continuous integration testing, we use Travis-CI. Every commit
pushed to the git repository or every pull request, triggers the build.
Additionaly, in Github there is a litle checkmark beside every commit,
signaling the status of the build (successful, unsucessful, ongoing).

The build that is executed on Travis-CI is defined in `.travis.yml`
situated in the root folder of the project, and looks like this:

@@snip[.travis.yml](../../../../../.travis.yml) { }

It basically means:

   - use the virtual machine based environment (line 1)
   - checkout git with a shorter history (lines 2-3)
   - add scala libraries (lines 4-6)
   - add oracle jdk version 8 (lines 7-8)
   - cache some directories between builds to make it faster (line
     9-11)
   - start fuseki and afterwards start all tests (lines 12-14)
   - send notification to our slack channel (lines 15-17)

## SBT Build Configuration

@@snip[WebapiBuild.sbt](../../../../../webapi/WebapiBuild.sbt) { }

## Webapi Server Startup-Flags

The Webapi-Server can be started with a number of flags. These flags can
be supplied either to the `reStart` or the `run` command in sbt, e.g.,:

```
$ sbt
> reStart flag
```

or

```
$ sbt
> run flag
```

### `loadDemoData` - Flag

When the webapi-server is started with the `loadDemoData` flag, then at
startup, the data which is configured in `application.conf` under the
`app.triplestore.rdf-data` key is loaded into the triplestore, and any
data in the triplestore is removed beforehand.

Usage:

```
$ sbt
> reStart loadDemoData
```
### `allowReloadOverHTTP` - Flag

When the webapi.server is started with the `allowReloadOverHTTP` flag (`reStart -r`),
then the `v1/store/ResetTriplestoreContent` route is activated. This
route accepts a `POST` request, with a JSON payload consisting of the
following example content:

```
[
  {
    "path": "../knora-ontologies/knora-base.ttl",
    "name": "http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base"
  },
  {
    "path": "../knora-ontologies/salsah-gui.ttl",
    "name": "http://www.knora.org/ontology/salsah-gui"
  },
  {
    "path": "_test_data/ontologies/incunabula-onto.ttl",
    "name": "http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula"
  },
  {
    "path": "_test_data/all_data/incunabula-data.ttl",
    "name": "http://www.knora.org/data/incunabula"
  }
]
```

This content corresponds to the payload sent with the
`ResetTriplestoreContent` message, defined inside the
`org.knora.webapi.messages.v1.store.triplestoremessages` package. The
`path` being the relative path to the `ttl` file which will be loaded
into a named graph by the name of `name`.

Usage:

```
$ sbt
> reStart allowReloadOverHTTP
```
