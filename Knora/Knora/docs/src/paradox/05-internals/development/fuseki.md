# Starting Fuseki 3

## Locally

Inside the Knora git repository, there is a folder called
`triplestores/fuseki` containing a script named `fuseki-server`. All
needed configuration files are in place. To start Fuseki 3, just run
this script:

    $ ./fuseki-server

## Inside Docker

We can use the `dhlabbasel:fuseki` docker image from docker hub:

    $ docker run --rm -it -p 3030:3030 dhlabbasel/fuseki
