## Version 1.0 Responders

### ResponderManagerV1

### CkanResponderV1

### HierarchicalListsResponderV1

### OntologyResponderV1

The ontology responder provides information derived from all the
ontologies in the repository, including Knora ontologies as well as
project-specific ontologies. Most importantly, it provides information
about resource classes and properties. This includes the cardinalities
defined on each resource class, and takes into account the rules of
cardinality inheritance, as described in the section **OWL
Cardinalities** in @ref:[OWL Cardinalities](../../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#owl-cardinalities).

For performance reasons, all ontology data is loaded and cached at
application startup. Currently, to refresh the cache, you must restart
the application. The responder calculates class hierarchies and cardinality
inheritance in Scala.
