# Authentication in Knora

@@toc

## Scope

Authentication is the process of making sure that if someone is
accessing something then this someone is actually also the someone he
pretends to be. The process of making sure that someone is authorized,
i.e. has the permission to access something, is handled as described in
@ref:[Authorisation](../../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#authorisation)).

## Implementation

The authentication in Knora is based on Basic Auth [HTTP basic
authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication),
URL parameters, [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io), and cookies. This means
that on every request (to any of the routes), credentials need to be
sent either via authorization header, URL parameters or cookie header.

All routes are always accessible and if there are no credentials
provided, a default user is assumed. If credentials are sent and they
are not correct (e.g., wrong username, password incorrect, token
expired), then the request will end in an error message.

There are some differences in `V1` and `V2` of the API regarding
authentication. They differ mainly in the format of the response and
that creation of session cookies are only supported in `V1` and tokens
in `V2`. After login via either version, all routes (`V1` and `V2`) are
accessible.

## Usage V1

### Login and Logout

When a client accesses the **/v1/session?login** route successfully, it
gets back headers requesting that a cookie is created, which will store
the session token. On all subsequent calls to any route, this session
token needs to be sent with each request. Normally, a web browser does
this automatically, i.e. sends the cookie on every request. The session
token is used by the server to retrieve the user profile. If successful,
the user is deemed authenticated.

To **logout** the client can call the same route and provide the logout
parameter **/v1/session?logout**. This will invalidate the session token
and return headers for removing the cookie on the client.

### Submitting Credentials

For **login**, credentials in form of *email* and *password* need to be
sent with the request.

There are two possibilities to do so:

  - in the URL submitting the parameters `email` and `password`
    (e.g.,
    <http://knora-host/v1/resources/resIri?email=userUrlEncodedEmail&password=pw>)
  - in the HTTP authorization header ([HTTP basic
    authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication))
    when doing a HTTP request to the API When using Python's module
    `requests`, the credentials can simply be submitted as a tuple
    with each request using the param `auth` ([python
    requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/authentication/#basic-authentication)).

An alternative way for accessing all routes is to simply supply the
*email* and *password* credentials on each request either as URL
parameters or in the HTTP authorization header.

### Checking Credentials

To check the credentials, there is a special route called
**/v1/authenticate**, which can be used to check if the credentials are
valid.

### Usage Scenarios

1.  Create session by logging-in, send session token on each subsequent
    request, and logout when finished.
2.  Send email/password credentials on every request.

## Usage V2

### Login and Logout

A client sends a POST request (e.g., `{"email":"usersemail",
"password":"userspassword"}`) to the **/v2/authentication** route with
*email* and *password* in the body. If the credentials are valid, a
[JSON WEB Token](https://jwt.io) (JWT) will be sent back in the response
(e.g., `{"token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJ..."}`). On all subsequent calls to any
route, this token can be sent with each request (instead of
*email*/*password*). If the token is successfully validated, then the
user is deemed authenticated.

To **logout** the client sends a DELETE request to the same route
**/v2/authentication** and the token (either as an URL parameter or
authorization header). This will invalidate the token.

### Submitting Credentials

When accessing any route and *email*/*password* credentials would
need to be sent, we support two options to do so:

- in the URL submitting the parameters `email` and `password`
  (e.g., <http://knora-host/v1/resources/resIri?email=userUrlEncodedEmail&password=pw>)
- in the HTTP header ([HTTP basic
  authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication))
  when doing a HTTP request to the API When using Python's module
  `requests`, the credentials can simply be submitted as a tuple
  with each request using the param `auth` ([python
  requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/authentication/#basic-authentication)).

When accessing any route and the *token* would need to be sent, we
support two options to do so:

- in the URL submitting the parameter `token` (e.g.,
  <http://knora-host/v1/resources/resIri?token=1234567890>)
- in the HTTP authorization header with the
  @extref[HTTP bearer scheme](rfc:6750#section-2.1).

### Checking Credentials

To check the credentials, there is a special route called
**/v1/authenticate**, which can be used to check if the credentials are
valid.

### Usage Scenarios

1.  Create token by logging-in, send token on each subsequent request,
    and logout when finished.
2.  Send email/password credentials on every request.

## Skipping Authentication

There is the possibility to turn skipping authentication on and use a
hardcoded user (Test User). In **application.conf** set the
`skip-authentication = true` and Test User will be always assumed.

## Sipi (Media Server)

For authentication to work with the media server, we need to add support
for cookies. At the moment the SALSAH-App would set BasicAuth heathers,
but this only works for AJAX requests using `SALSAH.ApiGet` (`Put`,
etc.). Since the medias are embedded as source tags, the browser would
get them on his own, and doesn't know anything about the needed
AuthHeathers. With cookies, the browser would send those automatically
with every request. The media server can use the credentials of the user
requesting something for accessing the RepresentationsRouteV1, i.e. make
this request in the name of the user so to speak, then the
RepresentationResponderV1 should have all the information it needs to
filter the result based on the users permissions.

## Improving Security

In the first iteration, the email/password would be sent in clear text.
Since we will use HTTPS this shouldn't be a problem. The second
iteration, could encrypt the email/password.
