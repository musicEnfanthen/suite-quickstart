# Knora API Server Design Overview

@@toc

## Introduction

Knora implements Knora's web-based Application
Programming Interface (API). It is responsible for receiving HTTP
requests from clients (which may be web browsers or other software),
performing authentication and authorisation, querying and updating the
RDF triplestore, transforming the results of SPARQL queries into Knora
API responses, and returning these responses to the client. It is
written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), using the
[Akka](http://akka.io/) framework for message-based concurrency. It is
designed to work with any standards-compliant triplestore. It can
communicate with triplestores either via the [SPARQL 1.1
Protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) or by embedding the
triplestore in the API server as a library.

## Actor Supervision and Creation

At system start, the supervisor actors are created in
`KnoraService.scala`:

```scala
val responderManager = system.actorOf(Props(new ResponderManagerV1 with LiveActorMaker), name = "responderManager")
val storeManager = system.actorOf(Props(new StoreManager with LiveActorMaker), name = "storeManager")
```

Each supervisor creates and maintains a pool of workers, with [an Akka
router](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/routing.html) that
dispatches messages to the workers according to some strategy. For now,
all the pools use the 'round-robin' strategy. The pools and routers are
configured in `application.conf`:

```
actor {
    deployment {
        user/storeManager/triplestoreRouter {
            router = round-robin-pool
            nr-of-instances = 50
        }

        user/responderManager/resourcesRouter {
            router = round-robin-pool
            nr-of-instances = 20
        }

        user/responderManager/valuesRouter {
            router = round-robin-pool
            nr-of-instances = 20
        }

        user/responderManager/representationsRouter {
            router = round-robin-pool
            nr-of-instances = 20
        }

        user/responderManager/usersRouter {
            router = round-robin-pool
            nr-of-instances = 20
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally, in `KnoraService` also the `akka-http` layer is started:

```scala
val host = settings.httpInterface
val port = settings.httpPort
val bindingFuture: Future[ServerBinding] = Http().bindAndHandle(Route.handlerFlow(apiRoutes), host, port)
println(s"Knora API Server started. You can access it on http://${settings.httpInterface}:${settings.httpPort}.")

bindingFuture.onFailure {
    case ex: Exception =>
    log.error(ex, s"Failed to bind to ${settings.httpInterface}:${settings.httpPort}!")
}
```

## Coordinated Application Startup

To coordinate necessary startup tasks, the application goes through a few states at startup:

  - Stopped: Application starting. Http layer is still not started.
  - StartingUp: Http layer is started. Only '/health' and monitoring routes are working.
  - WaitingForRepository:
  - RepositoryReady:
  - CreatingCaches:
  - CachesReady:
  - LoadingOntologies:
  - OntologiesReady:
  - MaintenanceMode: During backup or other maintenance tasks, so that access to the API is closed
  - Running: Running state. All APIs are open.

                                                

## Concurrency

Except for a bit of caching, Knora is written in a purely
functional style and has no mutable state, shared or otherwise, not even
within actors. This makes it easier to reason about concurrency, and
eliminates an important potential source of bugs (see [Out of the Tar Pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf)).

There is a pool of HTTP workers that handle HTTP requests concurrently
using the spray routes in the `routing` package. Each spray route
constructs a request message and sends it to `ResponderManagerV1`, which
forwards it to a worker actor in one of its pools. So the size of the
HTTP worker pool sets the maximum number of concurrent HTTP requests,
and the size of the worker pool for each responder sets the maximum
number of concurrent messages for that responder. Whenever a responder
needs to do a SPARQL query, it sends a message to the store manager,
which forwards it to a triplestore actor. The size of the pool(s) of
triplestore actors sets the maximum number of concurrent SPARQL queries.

The routes and actors in Knora use Akka's `ask` pattern,
rather than the `tell` pattern, to send messages and receive responses,
because this simplifies the code considerably (using `tell` would
require actors to maintain complex mutable state), with no apparent
reduction in performance.

To manage asynchronous communication between actors, the Knora API
server uses Scala's `Future` monad extensively. See
@ref:[Futures with Akka](futures-with-akka.md) for details.

We use Akka's asynchronous logging interface (see [Akka Logging](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/logging.html)).

## What the Responders Do

In Knora, a 'responder' is an actor that receives a
request message (a Scala case class) in the `ask` pattern, gets data
from the triplestore, and turns that data into a reply message (another
case class). These reply messages are are defined in the `schemas`
package. A responder can produce a reply representing a complete API
response, or part of a response that will be used by another responder.
If it's a complete API response, it will extend `KnoraJsonResponse`,
which can be converted directly into JSON by calling its `toJsValue`
method (see the section on JSON below).

All messages to responders go through the responder supervisor actor
(`ResponderManagerV1`).

## Store Module (org.knora.webapi.store package)

The Store module is used for accessing the triplestore and other
external storage providers.

All access to the Store module goes through the `StoreManager`
supervisor actor. The `StoreManager` creates pools of actors, such as
`HttpTriplestoreActor`, that interface with the storage providers.

The contents of the `store` package are not used directly by other
packages, which interact with the `store` package only by sending
messages to `StoreManager`.

Generation and parsing of SPARQL are handled by this module.

See @ref:[Store Module](store-module.md) for a deeper discussion.

## Triplestore Access

SPARQL queries are generated from templates, using the
[Twirl](https://github.com/playframework/twirl) template engine. For
example, if we're querying a resource, the template will contain a
placeholder for the resource's IRI. The templates can be found under
`src/main/twirl/queries/sparql/v1`. So far we have been able to avoid
generating different SPARQL for different triplestores.

The `org.knora.webapi.store` package contains actors for communicating
with triplestores in different ways: a triplestore can be accessed over
HTTP via the [SPARQL 1.1
Protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/), or it can be
embedded in Knora. However, a responder is not expected
to know which triplestore is being used or how the triplestore is
accessed. To perform a SPARQL query, a responder sends a message to the
`storeManager` actor, like this:

```scala
private val storeManager = context.actorSelection("/user/storeManager")

// ...

private def getSomeValue(resourceIri: IRI): Future[String] = {
    for {
        sparqlQuery <- Future(queries.sparql.v1.txt.someTemplate(resourceIri).toString())
        queryResponse <- (storeManager ? SparqlSelectRequest(sparqlQuery)).mapTo[SparqlSelectResponse]
        someValue = // get some value from the query response
    } yield someValue
}
```

## Error Handling

The error-handling design has these aims:

1.  Simplify the error-handling code in actors as much as possible.
2.  Produce error messages that clearly indicate the context in which
    the error occurred (i.e. what the application was trying to do).
3.  Ensure that clients receive an appropriate error message when an
    error occurs.
4.  Ensure that `ask` requests are properly terminated with an
    `akka.actor.Status.Failure` message in the event of an error,
    without which they will simply time out (see
    [Ask: Send and Receive Future](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html?language=scala#ask-send-and-receive-future)).
5.  When a actor encounters an error that isn't the client's fault (e.g.
    a triplestore failure), log it, but don't do this with errors caused
    by bad input.
6.  When logging errors, include the full JVM stack trace.

The design does not yet include, but could easily accommodate,
translations of error messages into different languages.

A hierarchy of exception classes is defined in `Exceptions.scala`,
representing different sorts of errors that could occur. The hierarchy
has two main branches:

  - `RequestRejectedException`, an abstract class for errors that are
    the client's fault. These errors are not logged.
  - `InternalServerException`, an abstract class for errors that are not
    the client's fault. These errors are logged.

Exception classes in this hierarchy can be defined to include a wrapped
`cause` exception. When an exception is logged, its stack trace will be
logged along with the stack trace of its `cause`. It is therefore
recommended that low-level code should catch low-level exceptions, and
wrap them in one of our higher-level exceptions, in order to clarify the
context in which the error occurred.

To simplify error-handling in responders, a utility method called
`future2Message` is provided in `ActorUtils`. It is intended to be used
in an actor's `receive` method to respond to messages in the `ask`
pattern. If the responder's computation is successful, it is sent to the
requesting actor as a response to the `ask`. If the computation fails,
the exception representing the failure is wrapped in a `Status.Failure`,
which is sent as a response to the `ask`. If the error is a subclass of
`RequestRejectedException`, only the sender is notified of the error;
otherwise, the error is also logged and rethrown (so that the
`KnoraExceptionHandler` can handle the exception).

In many cases, we transform data from the triplestore into a `Map`
object. To simplify checking for required values in these collections,
the class `ErrorHandlingMap` is provided. You can wrap any `Map` in an
`ErrorHandlingMap`. You must provide a function that will generate an
error message when a required value is missing, and optionally a
function that throws a particular exception. Rows of SPARQL query
results are already returned in `ErrorHandlingMap` objects.

If you want to add a new exception class, see the comments in
`Exceptions.scala` for instructions.

### Transformation of Exception to Client Responses

The `org.knora.webapi.KnoraExceptionHandler` is brought implicitly into
scope of `akka-http`, and by doing so registered and used to handle the
transformation of all `KnoraExceptions` into `HttpResponses`. This
handler handles only exceptions thrown inside the route and not the
actors. However, the design of reply message passing from actors (by
using `future2Message`), makes sure that any exceptions thrown inside
actors, will reach the route, where they will be handled.

See also @ref:[Fuures with Akka](futures-with-akka.md).

## API Routing

The API routes in the `routing` package are defined using the DSL
provided by the
[akka-http](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/http/routing-dsl/index.html)
library. A routing function has to do the following:

1.  Authenticate the client.
2.  Figure out what the client is asking for.
3.  Construct an appropriate request message and send it to
    `ResponderManagerV1`, using the `ask` pattern.
4.  Return a result to the client.

To simplify the coding of routing functions, they are contained in
objects that extend `org.knora.webapi.routing.Authenticator`. Each
routing function performs the following operations:

1.  `Authenticator.getUserProfileV1` is called to authenticate the user.
2.  The request parameters are interpreted and validated, and a request
    message is constructed to send to the responder. If the request is
    invalid, `BadRequestException` is thrown. If the request message is
    requesting an update operation, it must include a UUID generated by
    `UUID.randomUUID`, so the responder can obtain a write lock on the
    resource being updated.

The routing function then passes the message to
`org.knora.webapi.routing.RouteUtils.runJsonRoute()`, which takes care
of sending the message to `ResponderManagerV1` and returning a response
to the client. Any exceptions thrown befor calling
`org.knora.webapi.routing.RouteUtils.runJsonRoute()` are handled by the
`KnoraExceptionHandler`.

See @ref:[How to Add an API Route](how-to-add-a-route.md) for an example.

## JSON

Knora parses and generates JSON using the
[spray-json](https://github.com/spray/spray-json) library.

The triplestore returns results in JSON, and these are parsed into
`SparqlSelectResponse` objects in the `store` package (by `SparqlUtils`,
which can be used by any actor in that package). A
`SparqlSelectResponse` has a structure that's very close to the JSON
returned by a triplestore via the [SPARQL 1.1
Protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/): it contains a header
(listing the variables that were used in the query) and a body
(containing rows of query results). Each row of query results is
represented by a `VariableResultsRow`, which contains a `Map[String,
String]` of variable names to values.

The `Jsonable` trait marks classes that can convert themselves into
spray-json AST objects when you call their `toJsValue` method; it
returns a `JsValue` object, which can then be converted to text by
calling its `prettyPrint` or `compactPrint` methods. Case classes
representing complete API responses extend the `KnoraResponseV1` trait,
which extends `Jsonable`. Case classes representing Knora values extend
the `ApiValueV1` trait, which also extends `Jsonable`. To make the
responders reusable, the JSON for API responses is generated only at the
last moment, by the `RouteUtils.runJsonRoute()` function.
