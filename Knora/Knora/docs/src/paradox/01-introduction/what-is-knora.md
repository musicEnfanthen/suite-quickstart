# What Is Knora?

Knora (Knowledge Organization, Representation, and Annotation) is a
a server application for storing, sharing, and working with humanities
data.

Knora is based on the idea that the continuous availability and
reusability of digital qualitative research data in the humanities
requires a common, flexible data representation and storage technology
capable of performing queries across large quantities of heterogeneous
data, organised according to project-specific data structures that
cannot be known in advance. It also requires a convenient,
storage-independent way for Virtual Research Environments (VREs) and
automated data-processing software to access, query, and add to this
data.

To solve the data representation and storage problem, Knora represents
humanities data as
[RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/) graphs,
using [OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/)
ontologies that express abstract, cross-disciplinary commonalities in
the structure and semantics of research data. Each project using Knora
extends these abstractions by providing its own project-specific
ontology, which more specifically describes the structure and semantics
of its data. Existing non-RDF repositories can readily be converted to
an RDF format based on the proposed abstractions. This design makes it
possible to preserve the semantics of data imported from relational
databases, XML-based markup systems, and other types of storage, as well
as to query, annotate, and link together heterogeneous data in a unified
way. By offering a shared, standards-based, extensible infrastructure
for diverse humanities projects, Knora also deals with the issue of
conversion and migration caused by the obsolescence of file and data
formats in an efficient and feasible manner.

To solve the access problem, Knora offers generic HTTP-based APIs. These
allow applications to query and work with data in terms of the concepts
expressed by the Knora ontologies, without dealing with the complexities of the
underlying storage system. This approach also allows Knora to provide
features that are not part of the RDF standards, such as access control and
automatic versioning of data, and to act as a gateway to other sorts of
repositories, including non-RDF repositories.

Knora uses a high-performance media server, called [Sipi](http://www.sipi.io/),
for serving and converting binary media files such as images and video. Sipi can
efficiently convert between many different formats on demand, preserving
embedded metadata, and implements the [International Image
Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](http://iiif.io/).

Knora can be used with a general-purpose, browser-based VRE called
[SALSAH](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Salsah/). Using the Knora API, a project
can also create its own VRE or project-specific web site, optionally
reusing components from SALSAH.
