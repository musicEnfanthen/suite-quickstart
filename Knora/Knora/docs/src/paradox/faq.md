# Frequently Asked Questions

@@toc { depth=2 }

## Triplestores

### Which triplestores can be used with Knora?

Knora is tested with [Ontotext GraphDB SE](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/).
Our goal is to support several triplestores, including open-source options.
Integration with [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/)
has been partly implemented, but is not currently supported.

## Knora Ontologies

### Can a project use classes or properties defined in another project's ontology?

No, and Knora API v2 will forbid this. Each project must be free to change its
own ontologies, but this is not possible if they have been used in ontologies or
data created by other projects.

Instead, there will be a process for standardising ontologies that can be shared
by multiple projects (issue @github[#523](#523)).

### Why doesn't Knora use `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` for consistency checking?

Knora's consistency checking uses Knora-specific properties, which are called
`knora-base:subjectClassConstraint` and `knora-base:objectClassConstraint` in
the `knora-base` ontology, and `knora-api:subjectType` and `knora-api:objectType`
in the `knora-api` ontologies. These properties express *restrictions* on the
possible subjects and objects of a property. If a property's subject or object
does not conform to the specified restrictions, Knora considers it an error.

In contrast,
[the RDF Schema specification says](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domainrange)
that `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` can be used to "infer additional information"
about the subjects and objects of properties, rather than to enforce restrictions.
This is, in fact, what RDFS reasoners do in practice. For example, consider these
statements:

```
example:hasAuthor rdfs:range example:Person .
data:book1 example:hasAuthor data:oxygen .
```

To an RDFS reasoner, the first statement means: if something is used as
the object of `example:hasAuthor`, we can infer that it's an
`example:Person`.

The second statement is a mistake; oxygen is not a person. But
an RDFS reasoner would infer that `data:oxygen` is actually an
`example:Person`, since it is used as the object of
`example:hasAuthor`. Queries looking for persons would then get
`data:oxygen` in their results, which would be incorrect.

Therefore, `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` are not suitable for consistency
checking.

Knora therefore uses its own properties, along with
OWL cardinalities, which it interprets according to a "closed world"
assumption. Knora performs its own consistency checks to enforce
these restrictions. Knora repositories can also take advantage of
triplestore-specific consistency checking mechanisms.

The constraint language [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) may someday
provide a standard, triplestore-independent way to implement consistency
checks, if the obstacles to its adoption can be overcome
(see [Diverging views of SHACL](https://research.nuance.com/diverging-views-of-shacl/)).
For further discussion of these issues, see
[SHACL and OWL Compared](http://spinrdf.org/shacl-and-owl.html).

### Can a project-specific property be an `owl:TransitiveProperty`?

No, because in Knora, a resource controls its properties. This basic
assumption is what allows Knora to enforce permissions and transaction
integrity. The concept of a transitive property would break this assumption.

Consider a link property `hasLinkToFoo` that is defined as an `owl:TransitiveProperty`,
and is used to link resource `Foo1` to resource `Foo2`:

![Figure 1](faq-fig1.dot.png "Figure 1")

Suppose that `Foo1` and `Foo2` are owned by different users, and that
the owner of `Foo2` does not have permission to change `Foo1`.
Now suppose that the owner of `Foo2` adds a link from `Foo2` to `Foo3`,
using the transitive property:

![Figure 2](faq-fig2.dot.png "Figure 2")

Since the property is transitive, a link from `Foo1` to `Foo3` is now
inferred. But this should not be allowed, because the owner of `Foo2`
does not have permission to add a link to `Foo1`.

Moreover, even if the owner of `Foo2` did have that permission, the inferred
link would not have a `knora-base:LinkValue` (a reification), which every Knora
link must have. The `LinkValue` is what stores metadata about the creator
of the link, its creation date, its permissions, and so on
(see @ref:[LinkValue](02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#linkvalue)).

Finally, if an update to one resource could modify another
resource, this would violate Knora's model of transaction integrity, in which
each transaction can modify only one resource
(see @ref:[Application-level Locking](05-internals/design/triplestore-updates.md#application-level-locking)). Knora
would then be unable to ensure that concurrent transactions do not
interfere with each other.
