# The SALSAH 1 GUI

## Running the automated tests

In order to run the tests, the Selenium driver for Chrome has to be
installed.

It is architecture-dependent, so go to the `salsah1/lib/chromedriver`
directory and unzip the distribution that matches your architecture, or
download it from
[here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
and install it in this directory.

Then, launch the services as described above; the triple store with the
test data, the Knora server with `reStart -r` (`allowReloadOverHTTP`-flag) from SBT (from ``KNORA_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/webapi``), Sipi
with the test configuration (`--config=config/sipi.knora-docker-test-config.lua`) and SALSAH 1 where you can run the tests in
the same SBT session:

```
$ cd KNORA_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/salsah1
$ sbt
> compile
> reStart
> test
```

Note: please be patient as SALSAH 1 can take up to one minute (end of a
time-out) before reporting some errors.
