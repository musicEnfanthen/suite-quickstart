@import org.knora.webapi.IRI

@**
 * Given the IRI of a resource, gets the regions that point to this resource, using GraphDB.
 *
 * This template is used only by getRegions.scala.txt.
 *
 * Since the triplestore type is GraphDB, we assume that inference is enabled, and we use it to optimise the generated
 * SPARQL. Specifically, we use inference to return search results matching subproperties of Knora base properties
 * such as knora-base:isRegionOf. This requires us to use GraphDB's GRAPH <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit>
 * whenever we need to get explicit (non-inferred) statements.
 *
 * @param resourceIri the IRI of the resource.
