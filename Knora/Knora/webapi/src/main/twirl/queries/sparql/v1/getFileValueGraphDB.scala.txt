@import org.knora.webapi.IRI

@**
 * Given a knora:base:internalFilename, retrieves the file value and information attached to it, using GraphDB.
 *
 * This template is used only by getFileValue.scala.txt.
 *
 * Since the triplestore type is GraphDB, we assume that inference is enabled, and we use it to optimise the generated
 * SPARQL. Specifically, we use inference to return search results matching subproperties of Knora base properties
 * such as knora-base:hasFileValue. This requires us to use GraphDB's GRAPH <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit>
 * whenever we need to get explicit (non-inferred) statements.
 *
 * @param fileValueIri the IRI of the file value.
