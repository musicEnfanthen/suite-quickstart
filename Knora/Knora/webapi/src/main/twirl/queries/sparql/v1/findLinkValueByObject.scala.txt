@import org.knora.webapi.IRI

@**
 * Looks for a `knora-base:LinkValue` describing a direct link between two resources, returns all information
 * about it, and checks whether the direct link also exists.
 *
 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param subjectIri the IRI of the resource that is the source of the link.
 * @param predicateIri the IRI of the property that links the two resources.
 * @param maybeObjectIri if provided, the IRI of the resource that is the target of the link.
 * @param linkValueIri if provided, the IRI of the `LinkValue`.
 * @param includeDeleted if true, a `LinkValue` will be returned even if it is deleted. Currently this is
 *                       only for testing purposes.
