    /**
      * A convenience function that simplifies and centralises error-handling in the `receive` method of supervised Akka
      * actors that expect to receive messages sent using the `ask` pattern.
      *
      * Such an actor should handle errors by returning a [[Status.Failure]] message to the sender. If this is not done,
      * the sender's `ask` times out, and the sender has no way of finding out why. This function ensures that a
      * [[Status.Failure]] is sent.
      *
      * If an error occurs that isn't the client's fault, the actor will also want to report it to the actor's supervisor,
      * so the supervisor can carry out its own error-handling policy.
      *
      * It is also useful to give the sender the original exception object so that a stack trace can be
      * logged. However, some exception classes are not serializable and therefore cannot be sent as Akka messages. This
      * function ensures that stack traces are logged in those cases.
      *
      * The function takes as arguments the sender of the `ask` request, and a [[Future]] representing the result
      * of processing the request. It first converts the `Future` to a reply message, which it sends back to the sender.
      * If the `Future` succeeded, the reply message is the object it contains. If the `Future` failed, the reply message
      * is a [[Status.Failure]]. It will contain the original exception if it is serializable; otherwise, the original
      * exception is logged, and a [[WrapperException]] is sent instead. The [[WrapperException]] will contain the result
      * of calling `toString` on the original exception.
      *
      * After the reply message is sent, if the `Future` succeeded, or contained a [[RequestRejectedException]],
      * nothing more is done. If it contained any other exception, the function triggers the supervisor's error-handling
      * policy by throwing whatever exception was returned to the sender.
      *
      * @param sender the actor that made the request in the `ask` pattern.
      * @param future a [[Future]] that will provide the result of the sender's request.
      * @param log    a [[LoggingAdapter]] for logging non-serializable exceptions.
