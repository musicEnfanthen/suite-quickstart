/**
  * Contains instructions that can be given to a SPARQL template for updating direct links and `knora-base:LinkValue`
  * objects representing references to resources.
  *
  * @param linkPropertyIri         the IRI of the direct link property.
  * @param directLinkExists        `true` if a direct link already exists between the source and target resources.
  * @param insertDirectLink        `true` if the direct link should be inserted.
  * @param deleteDirectLink        `true` if the direct link should be deleted (because the reference count is being decremented
  *                                to 0).
  * @param linkValueExists         `true` if a `LinkValue` already exists describing a direct link between the source
  *                                and target resources.
  * @param linkTargetExists        `true` if the link target already exists, `false` if is being created in the same
  *                                SPARQL update operation.
  * @param newLinkValueIri         the IRI of the new `LinkValue` to be created.
  * @param linkTargetIri           the IRI of the target resource.
  * @param currentReferenceCount   the current reference count of the existing `LinkValue`, if any. This will be
  *                                0 if (a) there was previously a direct link but it was deleted (`directLinkExists` is
  *                                `false` and `linkValueExists` is `true`), or (b) there was never a direct link, and
  *                                there is no `LinkValue` (`directLinkExists` and `linkValueExists` will then be `false`).
  * @param newReferenceCount       the new reference count of the `LinkValue`.
  * @param newLinkValueCreator     the creator of the new `LinkValue`.
  * @param newLinkValuePermissions the literal that should be the object of the `hasPermissions` property of
  *                                the new `LinkValue`.
